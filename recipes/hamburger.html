        <p>This page will teach you how to make a hamburger with cheese!</p>
        <p>Here's what you need: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here's how to make it: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep seasoning.  Combine all spices in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li> Form patties. Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into 1/2 
                inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (as they will shrink).  
                Use your thumb to press an indentation into the center of each patty. 
                Cover and set aside.</li>
            <li><p>Grill. Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, 
                    indent-side up.</p> 
                <p>Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger 
                    is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger.</p> 
                <p>Flip and cook an additional 
                    3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F.</p> 
                <p>If adding cheese, place cheese slices on burgers during the last minute of cooking.</p></li>
            <li>Serve. Remove patties to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving in a 
                bun, with toppings.</li>
        </ol>
